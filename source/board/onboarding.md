# Board member onboarding

Welcome to the Board! Thanks for deciding on joining the station! There are a few things you will have to ensure that you need to do when you start your position.

0. Get on the WJRH Board email distribution list and learn how to use it
1. Meet other board members
2. Get yourself on the shared Google Drive. Every document important to the station lives on the shared station Google Drive folder and this resource will prove itself useful very quickly. All Board meeting minutes, past posters and their Illustrator design files, photographs from events and forms dealing with college bureaucracy can be found on the Google Drive. If you want something to persist over time, add it there
3. Have your ID card set up so that you get in 24/7
4. Obtain the WJRH account number. You will use this to purchase things using our budget
5. Get keys to the WJRH rooms. This is done by submitting a form (can be found on the Google Drive) together with the people that are getting keys with you to Plant Operations
6. Meet Kelly Deemer. She is the office assistant in the Student Life office. She will help you if you have questions regarding budgets, payments, and purchases
7. Learn how to register key cards
8. Learn how to set up a basic 'chill on the quad' music setup with the quadbox
9. Learn how to edit the website
10. Learn about the budget request processes and related resources
11. Learn how to use Airtime and get an account on it
12. If you're the chief engineer, take control and add yourself to the administrator and moderator lists on all three mailman lists.
13. If you're the chief engineer, add yourself as an admin to google analytics
14. If you're the chief engineer, take control of the servers

Don't worry, seniors are still around for an other semester to help you get things done. Feel free to send an email to the Board email distribution list for help.
