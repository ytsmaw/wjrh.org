# About

Broadcasting from Hogg Hall since 1946, WJRH has been a major part of life on Lafayette College's campus and beyond in the Lehigh Valley community. We provide the soundtrack to the Lafayette experience and make our voice heard by the greater community. You can listen to us 24/7 every day of the year on 104.9 FM in the area.

WJRH is one of the last college radio stations in the United States that is fully student managed and provides fully freeform programming. This means that we give 100% control to live DJs in the booth without any intervention or guidance from the Music Director. Freeform radio stations have always been at the forefront of the music world and we believe that we can achieve better programming through diversity.

WJRH is an all volunteer radio station. None of our members are paid for their efforts. The majority of WJRH's funding comes from Lafayette College with additional funding from individual donors and funding programs. We offer the opportunity for Lafayette students and community members to learn about music, radio engineering, audio production techniques, electrical engineering, acoustics, podcasting and how to manage a small business.

WJRH is a federally licensed FM station owned by the Lafayette College Board of Trustees, operating at 104.9 MHz. You can tune into our signal from most of the Lehigh Valley 24 hours a day. WJRH is a noncommercial educational radio station meaning that we never air commercials.
